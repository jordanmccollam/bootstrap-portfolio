                <p>I'm Jordan McCollam. Here's a little about me . . . I recently got married and moved to Nashville from California. 
                    I was previously a mix engineer / producer in the music industry but am now realizing that music feels more like a 
                    hobby to me than a career. I want to better benifit the world around me and make enough money in the process to 
                    support my new family. And that is what brought me to the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp, where I am now beginning my 
                    journey as a coder.</p>
                <p>So this is my first portfolio. By the end of this course I'm sure that this very website you're looking at will 
                    have grown into something much more impressive than what it initially was. I hope to wow you as you peek into my 
                    portfolio and show you that I am a hard worker, fast learner, and creative mind for any team or company.</p>
                <p>Now, some fun facts about myself, you know, for kicks and giggles. My wife is actually from the Netherlands. 
                    Though her first language is English, she's working on teaching me Dutch. I do play music! I play several instruments 
                    but am most fond of my Acoustic Guitar. I have a Gibson J-200 for any guitar nerds out there. Let's just say it's a 
                    great guitar. Lastly, I have a cool cat named Frankie. And I do mean cool. He's not like those cats who are actually
                    just demon spawns from hell. That's me!</p>
